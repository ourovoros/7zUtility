This batch file processes all files and folders in the current directory, decompresses files in .zip, .rar, .lzh, and .cbz formats, recompresses them to 7z format, and finally deletes the original files. However, if the source of the compression is a folder, it will be left intact. After processing, the temporary folder is cleaned up and closed.
